  # Hungarian has phonemic length (short vs long vowels).
  # Use a larger scale when we see ː on Hungarian phonemes.

    # Hungarian "é" is a long /eː/ that should be a clean monophthong.

    # an English "A"-like quality.
    - from: "eː"

    # eSpeak can emit palatal stops for Hungarian "ty" (/c/) and "gy" (/ɟ/).
    # NVSP doesn't model these as distinct consonants yet, so fall back.
