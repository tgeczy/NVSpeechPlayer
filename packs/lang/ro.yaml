normalization:
  # eSpeak (classic) Romanian IPA frequently uses plain two-character sequences
  # for affricates (ts/tʃ/dʒ) rather than tie-bar forms. We map them to the
  # dedicated affricate phonemes so timing comes out more naturally.
  preReplacements:
    - from: "ts"
      to: "t͡s"
    - from: "tʃ"
      to: "t͡ʃ"
    - from: "dʒ"
      to: "d͡ʒ"

    # Romanian â/î often surfaces as /ɨ/ with a glide; eSpeak sometimes writes
    # these as yɪ / yʊ sequences. Approximate with /ɨj/ and /ɨu/.
    - from: "yɪ"
      to: "ɨj"
    - from: "yʊ"
      to: "ɨu"

  replacements:
    # Mnemonic fallback: y -> ɨ
    - from: "y"
      to: "ɨ"
